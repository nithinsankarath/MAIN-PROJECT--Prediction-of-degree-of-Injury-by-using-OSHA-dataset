# MAIN-PROJECT--Prediction-of-degree-of-Injury-by-using-OSHA-dataset
This project successfully built a predictive model using OSHA accident and inspection data to classify the degree of injury in workplace incidents. By using a Random Forest Classifier the model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its potential for real world application. Insights from feature importance suggest that significantly influence injury severity,offering valuable information for targeted safety measures. While the model requires all features for optimal performance, future improvements could focus on simplifying feature requirements. Overall, this project shows how machine learning can contribute to enhancing workplace safety and guiding inspection priorities.
